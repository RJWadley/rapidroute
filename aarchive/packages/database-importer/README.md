# Database Importer

Imports data from various spreadsheets and dynmap into the RapidRoute database

## Development

1. Install dependencies from the root of the repository: `npm install`
2. Run the importer from this directory with: `npm start`

The script expects service account credentials in the env.
Reach out on Discord if you'd want access to the development database.

Alternatively, create your own Firebase project and use a service account for that project. The importer will work on any Realtime Database.

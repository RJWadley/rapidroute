# MRT RapidRoute

## Database Sources

In order of preference:

### Dynmap

some locations, like MRT stations and select airports, are mapped on the Dynmap.

### Wiki Data

Where possible, RapidRoute will pull information from the wiki.

### MRT Transit

The MRT Transit service maintains a list of flights, airports, and airlines.

### RapidRoute Data Spreadsheet

RapidRoute has a [data spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13t7mHiW9HZjbx9eFP2uTAO5tLyAelt5_iITqym2Ejn8/edit#gid=671025968) with some information. This is not a preferred source, and will eventually be phased out.

### Warp Data

Some companies have approved the use of warp data directly from the server. This is excellent geographical data, but lacks context and must be configured manually.
